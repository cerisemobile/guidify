Place a chicken in a coop and it will return there ti eat and sleep. Do not forget to keep replenishing the grain and water. Chickens lay eggs once a day, most often in the evening or at night. With at least one chicken and one rooster in the same coop, the chicken will soon lay a fertilized egg. Mother chickens are attentive to their eggs, sp if you pick up a fertilized one the chicken may start to bite you. You can purchase an ovoscope from the general store for candling eggs which will help you see if the egg is fertilized. Put unfertilized eggs in a basket to safely transport them to the store to sell, but leave fertilized eggs with their mothers to hatch naturally."

It also has one of the best top speeds in the game. What about the $1250 pickup, It can carry the same amount of animals as the $1400 1 here you ask. Well let me explain, the $1250 can in fact hold the same exact amount of animals, it also has the fastest acceleration. But the biggest problem is the handling.
